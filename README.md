Website i've made for my cs2 server for the plugin cs2-weaponpaints and wanted to share this with the community,<br>
please share with me your thoughts.

** To fix error of drivers please enable pdo_mysql **

Demo website:<br>

Easy to configure, i've made it very easy to customize the website as you like.

**Make sure to setup database and load the plugin first because the plugin generates the database tables!**<br>
link to the plugin:<br>
https://github.com/Nereziel/cs2-WeaponPaints

**Please edit only config.php and add your own files to translation folder (if you want to).**

for any bugs post an issue here at the github page and I will try to help you as soon as I can.
