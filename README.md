## Bugs
if you found any bug don't hesitate to open issue here at the github repository.
but please check old issues first to see if the bug is already discovered.

I have checked most of the textures of the 3D preview, but if you found any texture error let me know...

## To Do
* Display Stickers & Keychain on the 3D preview.
* Stickers & Keychain custom position.
* Update rest of the language files (only English and Hebrew up to date).
* Add models of characters (currently only weapons, knifes, gloves models exists).

would be happy if some of you can update the language files and send me, currently updated languages:
English, Hebrew.
